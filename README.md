# Machine Learning Students Association Workshops

The Python notebooks that accompany the MLSA workshops.

This is the second time (March, 2019) that we'll be running these workshops. We'll be incorporating some feedback from the last time they were held - namely, we'll be fleshing out some of the Supervised/Unsupervised learning workshops. So expect more updates over the next few months.

### Preliminary
* **workshop-PR01**, Setting up + Intro to data analysis
* **workshop-PR02**, The briefest intro to modelling

### Supervised Learning
* **workshop-SL01**, Classification
* **workshop-SL02**, Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
* **workshop-UL01**, Unsupervised Learning

### Deep Learning
* **workshop-DL01**, Deep Neural Networks
* **workshop-DL02**, Convolutional Neural Networks
* **workshop-DL03**, Recurrent Neural Networks

### Reinforcement Learning
* **workshop-RL01**, Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
* **workshop-RL02**, Policy-Based (Policy Gradient)
* **workshop-RL03**, Value-Based (DQN)
* **workshop-RL04**, Policy & Value-Based (A3C)

### Other Ideas 
* Word2Vec
* Gaussian Processes
* Visualization (seaborn, d3.js, PCA)
