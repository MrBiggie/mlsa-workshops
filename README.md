# Machine Learning Students Association Workshops

The Python notebooks that accompany the MLSA workshops.

This is the first time (August, 2018) that any of these workshops have ever been run; most of them haven't been uploaded yet (and even those that have a are still in a state of flux). We're expecting the workshops to stabilise as we actually deliver them over the next few months.
