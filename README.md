# Machine Learning Students Association Workshops

The Python notebooks that accompany the MLSA workshops.

This is the second time (March, 2019) that we'll be running these workshops. We'll be incorporating some feedback from the last time they were held - namely, we'll be fleshing out some of the Supervised/Unsupervised learning workshops. So expect more updates over the next few months.

### Preliminary

* **workshop-PR02**, Data Science Process

### Deep Learning
* **workshop-DL01**, Deep Neural Networks
* **workshop-DL02**, Convolutional Neural Networks
* **workshop-DL03**, Recurrent Neural Networks

### Supervised Learning\*
* **workshop-SL01**, Introduction to Supervised Learning
* **workshop-SL02**, Classification
* **workshop-SL03**, Regression

### Unsupervised Learning\*
* **workshop-UL01**, Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

### Reinforcement Learning\*\*
* **workshop-RL01**, Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
* **workshop-RL02**, Policy-Based (Policy Gradient)
* **workshop-RL03**, Value-Based (DQN)
* **workshop-RL04**, Policy & Value-Based (A3C)

### Miscellaneous\*
* **workshop-MSC01**, Word2Vec
* **workshop-MSC02**, Gaussian Processes

\* To be scheduled.  
\*\* Half-completed.
